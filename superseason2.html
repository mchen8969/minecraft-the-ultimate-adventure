Yeah... she got really mad when <notch>NOTCH</notch> patched her Bedrock glitch machine so she decided to conjure the <wither>Super Wither</wither>. She went to the <witch>Witches of the West</witch> and was like “Let's make a <wither>Super Wither</wither> and destroy <notch>NOTCH</notch> ” (She was super <salt>SALTY</salt>). The <witch>Witches of the West</witch> hated <notch>NOTCH</notch> now so they were like ok sure m8. We studied for years and we learned that Steve is just some random dude and not <notch>NOTCH</notch>’s son. So together, they conjured a <wither>Super Wither</wither>. The <wither>Super Wither</wither> was destroying <villa>villages</villa> everywhere until the <protector>PROTECTORS OF THE PEACE</protector> (Steve, Alex, and their <rainbow>TRUE LOVE Apprentice</rainbow> James) decided to stop the <wither>Super Wither</wither>. The thing was that the <wither>Super Wither</wither> had the <yeet1>super yeeterium shield</yeet1> which could reflect their <rainbow>TRUE LOVE Powers</rainbow>.

Well, after the <past>Super Season 1 Finale</past>, Steve and Alex gave the <sy>syringe</sy> to James while training him, so when he fell on top of <rosaline>Rosaline</rosaline> <redstone>the Redstoner</redstone>, she was stabbed by the <sy>syringe</sy>. <rosaline>Rosaline</rosaline> <redstone>the Redstoner</redstone> fell to the ground with <x>X’s</x> over her eyes.

        <p style = "position: absolute; z-index: 0;">When the pain faded, and they finally could move, they found that the area around them was completely <devastation>DEVASTATED</devastation>. With only several spots still covered in <blackred>black and red</blackred> <sludge>sludge</sludge>, all they could do was to <fire>blast</fire> away the sludge with their <rainbow>TRUE LOVE Beams</rainbow>. The <blackred>black and red</blackred> <sludge>sludge</sludge> was all gone by the time they were done, and they were happy that they had done the world a service.</p>

      <div style = "border: 0px; position: relative; height: 110px;">

        <p style = "position: absolute; z-index: 0;">They then walked around, and soon found a poster taped to a nearby tree. It said that the <wizard>Wizards of the North</wizard> had their <cookie>super cookie</cookie> recipe dropped in <lava>lava</lava>, and the <cookie>super cookie</cookie> were stolen by James the demon?!?!?!</p>

      <div style = "border: 0px; position: relative; height: 120px;">

        <p style = "position: absolute; z-index: 0;">However, as they began to figure things out from other posters on trees, they figured that they needed a <sun>sunstone apple</sun> in order to swim and see through the lava to find the <cookie>super cookies</cookie>. But, the <sun>sunstone apple</sun>, would only be found in the <far>FAR LANDS</far>, and so, with their <rainbow>TRUE LOVE</rainbow> powers, they flew in the direction of the <far>FAR LANDS</far>.</p>

      <div style = "border: 0px; position: relative; height: 270px;">

        <p style = "position: absolute; z-index: 0;">	As they approached the <far>FAR LANDS</far>, they began to see signs of James being there. They saw dark fire glowing on the ground, and <blackred>black and red</blackred> <sludge>sludge</sludge> oozing along, carvindg channels in the rock from the <acid>acidity</acid> of it. They knew James has been there cause James is a slob. The stone was so hot, that sections of it had began to <magma>turn into magma</magma>, and they set themselves down onto a section of cooler rock and looked around themselves. The surrounding area looked like parts of the nether, and would sometimes have the <brightblood>acidic</brightblood> <epic>sludge</epic> flowing through it. Then, they found a <bred>red glow</bred>, and they began to follow it, it looked similar to the <red>yeeterium constructs</red>, so the cautiously sneaked towards the <bred>glow</bred>.</p>


      </div>

      <div style = "border: 0px; position: relative; height: 80px;">

        <p style = "position: absolute; z-index: 0;">They peeked inside, and found a <mystery>mysterious portal</mystery>, with a netherrack frame, and a <portal>red portal</portal> in the center of it. They suddenly felt a <tingle>tingle</tingle>. It was as if another timeline was created.</p>
