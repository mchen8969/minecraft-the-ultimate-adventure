      <p style = "position: absolute;">Once upon a time, there was a Minecraftian called Steve. He had a friend named Alex. He had a crush on her since <grade>-69th Grade</grade>, but she liked this <crook>Level 1 Crook</crook> John. John decided to prove his love by defeating the <boss>Level 100 Boss</boss> Ender Dragon with her. But John is doo-doo at fighting and failed. The ender dragon captured Alex. So Steve was like “<time>THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE AND PROVE MYSELF TO THE WORLD</time>.” So he <yeet>YEETED</yeet> the ender dragon really hard and won, but he forgot about the dragon’s son and left the egg at the End. Alex cried out, “NOOOOO JOOOOOOOOHN,” because he died while he was <fight>fighting</fight> the ender dragon because he was a noob at this kind of stuff. But Steve cheered her up through the power of “<rainbow>TRUE LOVE!!</rainbow>”. They studied this new power of love and became  <rainbow>TRUE LOVE Apprentices</rainbow>. They could control the power of love just like those nerds from Dragon Ball <dbz>Z</dbz>. So basically they made some epic gamer moments.</p>

      <p style = "position: absolute;">Ok, so Steve left the End without the Ender Dragon Egg because he thought he was too good and could just <mlg>MLG Oneshot 360 No-Scope</mlg> the egg later (and he was also too lazy to do anything). So then the baby <ender>Super Ender Dragon</ender> came out of his egg like a constipated giraffe/stegosaurus hybrid trying to headbutt the ceiling of a convertible that’s inside the sinking Titanic, which is then crammed into an elevator that blows up. The <ender>Super Ender Dragon</ender> was like really angry because his dad was gone, so he flew to Steve and Alex’s is <rainbow>TRUE LOVE Temple</rainbow> and started destroying everything, and they were like “Oh no!” So then, They decided to use the art of <rainbow>TRUE LOVE</rainbow>, and Steve <shrek>Shrek-ed</shrek> the <ender>Super Ender Dragon</ender>, and he won! So everyone was like “WOW” those are some <mlg>PRO-GAMER SKILLS</mlg>, but in the End, there was another egg, and it was the <ender>SUPER DUPER ENDER DRAGON</ender>. <small>(Dun Dun DUN)</small>

The <witch>Witches of the West</witch> were like what are you gonna give us in return for our <rainbow>Awesomer Knowledges</rainbow>. Steve said, “I can increase your <rainbow>Knowledges</rainbow> with my <rainbow>Awesomeness</rainbow>!!!” So then the <witch>Witches</witch> were like “Oh no! He beat the system! He must be the God <notch>NOTCH</notch>’s Son! So they use said that basically, you need to consult the <redstone>Redstoners of the Red Land</redstone>. So they went to them and they said “You need to consult… whatever just make a bedrock glitch machine”. So they hired <rosaline>Rosaline</rosaline> <redstone>the Redstoner</redstone>. She built it with the power of <redstone>Redstone</redstone>, and they were about to turn it on and she hit the lever. <small>(Drumroll)</small></p>

      <p style = "position: absolute; z-index: 0;">They arrived at the End and saw a green human-like creature fighting the <ender>Super Duper Ender Dragon</ender>. The seemingly heroic minecraftian turned around and said “<alien>HALLO. I AM ALIEN JAMES I…</alien>” Because this James dude was really stupid, the <ender>Super Duper Ender Dragon</ender> appeared and <blood>killed</blood> him. Steve and Alex were like “Oh No! Jaaaames!” They got really angry, and Steve used all of his <rainbow>TRUE LOVE</rainbow> powers and threw the <sy>syringe</sy>. The <sy>syringe</sy> started <glow>glowing</glow>, became <k>over 9000</k> times bigger, morphed into a dragon just like the <ender>Super Duper Ender Dragon</ender>, except pure <power>white</power>, the needle became much longer, traveled at the speed of sound, with a tail of rainbow fires, and it looked basically like an <epic>epic final smash move</epic>. Steve’s throw <miss>missed</miss> by a few trillion <light>light years</light>. The <ender>Super Duper Ender Dragon</ender> was like “<dragon>GAAAAAAAH, YOU’LL NEVER CATCH ME ALIVE WITH THAT FISH THING!</dragon>” He started flying away, but Alex used her <rainbow>TRUE LOVE</rainbow> powers and <blast>blasted</blast> him out of the air like a WWII anti-aircraft gun. The <ender>Super Duper Ender Dragon</ender>, too far from any End Crystals, fell. This wasn’t the <i>end</i> for the dragon though <small>(ba dum tss)</small>. He teleported back to the island. Seeing Steve and Alex drained of their powers, he giggled. “<ender>HAW HAW HAW</ender>!” he said, “<ender>I AM BASICALLY INVIN-</ender>”. *<red>Wham</red>* The <sy>syringe</sy> was back! The <ender>Super Duper Ender Dragon</ender> flew away never to be seen again. Steve and Alex were like <bred>YAAAAAAAAA</bred> <by>YAAAAAAAA</by> <bb>YAAAAAAAA</bb><small>x100</small>. They saved James with their <rainbow>TRUE LOVE</rainbow> powers, and all three <amigo>amigos</amigo> teleported back with the evil inside of James leaving him to become its own being: James the alien 2.0. They did it! They tore apart and <savage>savagely destroyed</savage> the <family>Ender Dragon Family</family>! Back at the temple, they introduced James to the power of <rainbow>TRUE LOVE</rainbow>. James saw the power it held, and immediately declared lessons. Steve and Alex, having over <iq>9000 IQ </iq>were like “Yeah, okay, this is totally a good idea. Giving some <shade>shady stranger</shade> <rainbow>Epic Powers of Awesomeness</rainbow>  is a really good idea.” Suddenly, the temple started <by>glowing</by>. They were becoming <rainbow>TRUE LOVE Monks</rainbow>! Their objective now was to train James as best as they could. (For now though...)
